# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 1.3.6 - 2026-08-13
### Changed

- **Bachus UX:** prefilled receive/issue/adjust opens a confirm-only booking strip (qty + confirm) when item, location, and quantity are known; scan codes resolve on Enter; dashboard keeps Receive/Issue primary and tucks Transfer/Adjust under “More stock actions”; tables use card reflow (`.iv-table--responsive`) on narrow screens; empty item/location balances offer one-tap Receive; stocktake create auto-starts counting; settings restore deep-linkable `#iv-license` / `#iv-app-admins` anchors; fractional qty enable auto-reloads.
- **Bachus UX (pass 2):** New item shows SKU/Name first (expert fields under “More item options”); CSV import auto-checks on paste/file and collapses column help; pairing codes show inline (no second modal); location ACL uses searchable chips instead of Ctrl/Cmd multi-select.
- **Bachus UX (pass 3):** Movement filters auto-apply when values resolve; clean stocktakes close in one click (dirty ones still confirm).
- **Design system / settings multipage:** Settings split into catalog-driven sub-pages (`/settings/{section}`) with sidebar children + in-page chip bar; `/settings` redirects to Access; legacy `#anchor` bookmarks forward client-side; each page saves only its own topic. Danger buttons use `--iv-danger-*` tokens; movement filter apply refreshes `#iv-movements-results` without remounting the filter shell (race-safe load sequence).
- **Bachus UX (pass 4):** Dashboard low-stock is Receive-only; exports tuck under More; variance loads only when opened; search/filter Apply buttons are AT fallbacks (results update as you type/choose); cold-start booking is scan-first with browse-on-demand; new item = SKU+Name; new location = Code+Name; Access allow-lists appear only when restricted; dialogs use one × close; CSV auto-check only.
- **Bachus UX (pass 5):** Open stocktakes auto-start counting; dirty close uses confirm-as-consent (no checkbox traps); redundant search “active filter” chips removed; DATEV export under More; empty per-location low-stock section hidden; license seats/devices behind progressive disclosure.
- **Bachus UX (pass 6):** Prefillable transfers use confirm-only (incl. reverse); new stocktake is location-first (name under More, single location auto-selected); blind count under Counting options; CSV import confirms-as-skip for bad rows; field users get primary Issue; favourites use short aria-pressed toggles; `btn()` forwards ARIA attrs.
- **Guidance UX:** sidebar shows DutyCheck-style name + hint lines under every primary nav item; Access settings open with a dismissible Quick start (lockout safety) and an explicit “door vs stock” callout; License/Support page leads filled from the settings catalog.
- **Bachus UX (pass 7):** Single-location stocktake is 1-click (no dialog); item/location Deactivate (+ Download SVG) under More; movements filter title is screen-reader-only; Access drops the redundant default-open paragraph; label preview drops the instructional wall of text.
- **Bachus UX (pass 8):** Confirm-only bookings expose one-tap “Change item or location” (expands the full form — no close/reopen dead-end); negative-balance copy and primary CTA are “Set to zero” (matches Adjust-to-0 behaviour).
- **Bachus UX (pass 9):** Stocktake Enter advances to the next line; “Count remaining as system” fills uncounted page lines in one tap; item/location balance rows offer Receive/Issue; list Deactivate removed (detail More / Reactivate only); Label preview under closed disclosure; Movements Receive/Issue primary with exports under More; Status OK is screen-reader-only; empty filter-active hosts removed.
- **Bachus UX (pass 10):** Balance-row Receive/Issue opens qty-only confirm strip (masters known, qty optional); inventur Status column only when conflicts exist; “Count this page as system” honest naming; items/locations search intros are sr-only and Clear appears only when typing; Active Yes/No column replaced by Inactive badge on the name.

### Fixed

- **Aristoteles:** dialog single-overlay + `#iv-page-actions` inert (blocks double booking); Change binds local button + `dlg.close()` (no global Close click); delta reverse strips spurious `qty` on expand; movements filter `.catch` respects `loadSeq` / reuseShell; stocktake close prefers live line counts + pending-autosave gate; location ACL enabled-only save skips empty `setForSubject`; mobile session CSRF no longer accepts forged `Authorization: Bearer`.
- **Aristoteles (pass 2):** Stocktake close uses campaign-wide `linesUncounted` (never page-local filters — prevents silent over-abandon on paginated inventur); CSV dry-run sequenced + text-matched before Import; Change keeps chrome inert until replacement dialog mounts; New stocktake latched against double-create; items/locations listHost clears `aria-busy` on error; inventur rows label from API `itemName`/`sku`.

- **Security:** session-backed mobile mutations (`scan`, favourites, inventur count) require a CSRF requesttoken or `X-IV-Device-Token` — bare cookies can no longer drive NoCSRFRequired companion writes.
- **GDPR purge:** user-delete now clears office + low-stock notify lists, mobile seats, location favourites, and per-user location ACL grants (not only app-admin/allow lists).
- **Pairing DoS:** failed pairing rate limits are per client IP (hashed), so one attacker cannot freeze pairing for every scanner on the instance.
- **Deadlock:** serial `track_mode` flip mid-movement no longer escalates SHARE→EXCLUSIVE in-place; clients get `item_lock_conflict` (**HTTP 423 Locked**) and retry with a clean exclusive lock.
- **Deadlock:** flange multi-SKU issues sort by `itemId` ascending before posting (ABBA-safe vs inventur close).
- **UX / a11y contract:** removed foreign family class prefixes (`mc-`/`mn-`/…) from soft-keyboard CSS so InventoryCheck visual parity stays clean.
- **Inventur DoS/OOM:** stocktake create paginates the catalog and refuses more than 10 000 eligible lines (`stocktake_too_large`) instead of loading 100 000 SKUs in one shot.
- **Inventur show:** campaign lines are paginated (limit/offset, totals, conflict counts); web UI adds Previous/Next for large counts.
- **Photos:** upload/delete reject inactive items after the exclusive row lock.
- **Upgrade backup OOM:** table export streams row-by-row, refuses tables over 200 000 rows with a clear error, and pre-migration repair continues the upgrade (with a warning) instead of stalling maintenance mode.

### Changed

- Companion bootstrap `companionApi` uses an explicit `max()` ladder (item-photo floor + fractional bump) instead of a dead branch.

## 1.3.8 - 2026-08-19
### Changed

- English product name only everywhere (App Store metadata and in-app navigation): `InventoryCheck` — no localized `<name lang="...">` variants.
- App Store descriptions remain localized; added `AppBrandNameContractTest` to prevent brand-name drift.

## 1.3.7 - 2026-08-19
### Changed

- App Store release description updated to mark this as an early release and invite feedback (feedback link + messaging).

## 1.3.5 - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Packaging release: version bump for ready4upload / production archive (working tree already at 1.3.4).

## 1.3.4 - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- **Transfers:** mobile adjust/transfer accepts `toLocationCode` / `to_location_code` for destination scan confirm.
- **Bachus:** dashboard variance adjustments sit behind progressive disclosure (expert chrome).
- Expanded shell a11y fixtures, movement locking contracts, and mutation coverage.

## 1.3.3 — 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Version lockstep for Wave D companion follow-ups (item photo, AF-IV20, variance UI) after 1.3.2.

## 1.3.2 — 2026-08-01

- **AF-IV20:** `AppAccessMiddleware` maps `MobileGateException` → 402 only for `MobileController`; web session controllers rethrow (never 402 for license/seat misses).
- **Companion:** `GET /mobile/v1/items/{id}/photo` read-only item photo (device token or session seat); `companionApi` → **5**; `capabilities.itemPhoto`.
- **Wave D6 UI:** dashboard variance table (adjust movements) beside CSV export — loading / empty / error states, EN+DE l10n.


## 1.3.1 — 2026-08-01

- **Companion mobile API:** `/mobile/v1/favourites/locations` + `/mobile/v1/cycle-counts*` (session seats; devices excluded).
- **Bootstrap:** `companionApi` → **4**; `capabilities.favourites`; `isOffice` flag.
- **Inventur:** `setCount` allowed for any ACL-visible user (create/close remain office).
- **Wave D web UX:** reason-code picker on adjust; scan policies in Settings; target stock / default location on items; reorder + variance CSV links; location label print.
- **CSV / QtyScale:** DE headers for Wave D columns; format `suggestedQty` / `targetStock` on low-stock rows.
- **Variance export:** optional `reasonCode` filter.


## 1.3.0 — 2026-08-01

- **Wave D (warehouse / buyer / auditor hygiene):**
  - **D2:** `GET /api/locations/by-code/{code}` + mobile twin — exact location code resolve (ACL-safe).
  - **D1:** Location labels (QR + Code 128) + bulk A4 sheet (`/api/locations/labels`).
  - **D3:** Adjust reason codes (`inventur|damage|loss|found|correction|other`); `reason_code` on movements; `require_adjust_reason` (ensurer seeds on); `GET /api/reason-codes`.
  - **D4/D5:** Item `target_stock` + create/update validation; low-stock `suggestedQty`; CSV export kind `reorder`.
  - **D6:** CSV export kind `variance` (adjust movements).
  - **D7:** Item `default_location_id` + create/update (active location FK).
  - **D8:** `require_location_scan` + scan `locationCode` confirm (`location_code_mismatch`).
  - **D9:** `companionApi` → **3**; bootstrap exposes reason catalog + policy flags.
- **Inventur:** cycle-count close posts adjusts with reason code `inventur`.
- **Tests:** ReasonCodes, SuggestedOrder, location LabelSvg, MobileGate companionApi=3.

## 1.2.15 — 2026-07-31

- **Licensing:** IV2 license apply/remove, mobile seats, and scanner device pairing (`/api/license/*`) with `Iv2Codec` verification against the vendor public key.
- **Companion APIs:** mobile gate/bootstrap hardening; device actors stay usable under location ACL; seat and device management for Track L clients.
- **Shell / UX:** ArbeitszeitCheck-aligned chrome (tokens, navigation, page patterns); Support & Us in Settings; stocktake and label-sheet templates.
- **Validation:** config directory saves reject unknown user/group ids; expanded shell/e2e and license golden-fixture coverage.
- **Release:** sync `appinfo/version` with `info.xml` for the ready4upload production archive gate.

## 1.2.12 — 2026-07-26

- **Labels:** every printable label now includes **QR + Code 128** of the same `scan_code` (phone cameras and wedge/laser scanners).
- **UX:** item detail shows an inline label preview with print + SVG download; selectable scan-code text kept for A12.
- **Tests:** Code128 unit suite + label MSI harness; a11y/e2e contracts for barcode preview.
- **Tooling:** `composer test:mutation` aggregate now includes the label / qty-scale / stock-issue-facade harnesses (parity with the `test:msi` gate, which already ran them).

## 1.2.11 — 2026-07-26

- **B1:** block item/location delete and deactivate while referenced by an open/counting stocktake (`item_in_open_stocktake` / `location_in_open_stocktake`) — prevents permanently bricked inventur close.
- **A2∩A3:** CSV opening receives defer low-stock notify until after the import TX commits (parity with inventur/flange).

## 1.2.10 — 2026-07-26

- **C1:** item create/update reorder ceiling uses `QtyScale::maxStorage` (display >1000 works under fractional; matches CSV).
- **B1∩C2:** inventur close fails closed with `track_mode_changed` if a line item flips to lot/serial mid-campaign (no bricked `invalid_lot_code` close).

## 1.2.9 — 2026-07-26

- **B2 race:** unique index `iv_mov_ref_uq` on `(ref_type, ref_id, item_id)` so concurrent flange posts cannot double-issue the same SKU for one peer ref (NULLs for manual UI movements stay multi-row safe).
- **C2/S5:** restore item-row lock in `lockActiveItemForMovement` (serial exclusive / shared otherwise) — regression had used unlocked `findById`.
- **Tests:** Wave A/B suite resets `qty_scale` so CSV opening balances are not polluted by fractional Wave C runs.
- **Docs:** planning baseline + CHANGELOG aligned with live `info.xml`.

## 1.2.8 — 2026-07-26

- **B2∩A3:** flange bundle defers low-stock notify until after the outer TX commits (no phantom Notifications/Activity on rolled-back kits).
- **B2:** multi-line `insufficient_stock` reports the failing SKU, not the first line.

## 1.2.7 — 2026-07-26

- **B1 deadlock:** inventur `close()` locks location → items (asc) → balances (matches MovementService); `setCount` locks campaign before line (no ABBA vs close); low-stock notify deferred until after inventur TX commits.
- **i18n:** seven interpolating CSV/stocktake/label strings added EN+DE; l10n parity regex now catches `tr('…', {…})`.

## 1.2.6 — 2026-07-26

- **B1 race:** inventur `close()` locks all campaign balances `FOR UPDATE` before the conflict decision (kills TOCTOU wipe vs concurrent receive/issue).
- **C3:** cycle-count list filters location ACL in SQL (correct totals/pages; no 200-row post-filter window).
- **C1∩B2:** flange/facade success payloads return display qty (not storage milli-units).
- **Tests:** dual-process close×receive race; lockPairs-before-conflict contract + mutation needle.

## 1.2.5 — 2026-07-26

- **B1 / UC-C2:** cycle-count close fails closed on mid-count stock drift (`count_conflict`) unless office acknowledges; lines expose `currentQty` + `conflict`; stocktake UI shows live qty and text status (not color alone).
- **C1 ∩ B2/C5:** `StockIssueFacade` converts peer display qty → storage (fixes under-issue after fractional enable); HTTP flange no longer double-converts.
- **a11y:** stocktake axe fixture + live route; conflict close confirmations labelled.
- **Tests:** inventur conflict integration, facade scale unit + mutation needles.

## 1.2.4 — 2026-07-26

- **B1:** cycle-count close skips matching counts (no adjust noop abort) so inventur closes when shelf matches system.
- **C3:** cycle-count list/get honour location ACL (IDOR-safe; inaccessible campaigns 404 as `unknown_location`).
- **C1/A3 honesty:** insufficient-stock toasts and low-stock notify/activity params use display qty (not milli storage).
- **A3:** Activity provider registered so low-stock events render in the stream.
- **UX:** pagination omits dead Previous/Next (prefer omit over disable).

## 1.2.3 — 2026-07-26

- **A3:** low-stock notifications fire only on *newly enters* (open-episode key); recovery clears the episode; ≤1 fire / item / 24h; activity published to every recipient.
- **B2/C5:** `StockIssueFacade` honour IV flange toggles (no split-brain vs Settings).
- **A2:** CSV import accepts description / active / supplier_note / last_price_minor / opening_* (UI hint matches).
- **A5:** bulk “Print labels” omitted until selection; label sheets chunk into A4 pages of 12.
- **A1:** exports over 50k rows fail with `export_too_large` (no silent truncate).
- **A6:** CORE-APP-PLAN §4 baseline updated to shipped Waves A–C.

## 1.2.2 — 2026-07-26

- **Security (C3):** `byCode` balances, global low-stock sums, and location favourites honour location ACL (no hidden-van IDOR).
- **Devices:** `device:…` actors stay unrestricted under location ACL so scanners are not fail-closed when web field ACL is on.
- **A1:** CSV import accepts German headers (`Artikelnummer`, `Bezeichnung`, …); export supports `?lang=de`.
- **UX:** fractional settings omit the dead “already on” button; location ACL uses a multi-select of locations instead of raw ids.
- **Tests:** lot-mode movements, byCode/favourites/device ACL, DE CSV round-trip keys, QtyScale enable migration unit proof, a11y settings Wave C sections.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-07-26

- **Security (C3):** movement history and per-location low-stock respect location ACL (IDOR-safe empty results for hidden locations).
- **C1:** movement qty ceiling uses `QtyScale::maxStorage` so fractional bookings above 1000 display units work; CSV export writes display quantities for import round-trips.
- **C2∩B1:** cycle-count campaigns skip lot/serial SKUs (inventur without lot would break ledger invariants).
- **Mobile API:** scan accepts `lotCode` and display qty via `QtyScale`; list/bootstrap paths format quantities.
- **ACL writes:** `setForSubject` validates user/group/location existence (parity with access lists).
- **Flange HTTP:** line qty converted display→storage before issue.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-07-26

- **Fractional quantities (C1):** optional one-way enable (`POST /api/config/fractional`) rescales ledger ints ×1000; API returns display decimals; UI uses 0.001 steps; companion `companionApi` bumps to 2 when enabled.
- **Lot / serial tracking (C2):** items have `trackMode` (`none`/`lot`/`serial`); movements accept `lotCode`; serial capacity is one display unit (scale-aware); exclusive item lock prevents races.
- **Location ACL (C3):** optional per-location grants for field users (`GET`/`PUT /api/config/location-acl`); inaccessible locations 404 like unknown (IDOR-safe); office/admins unrestricted.
- **ProjectCheck flange (C5):** `issueForProject` + settings toggle; soft no-op when peer absent or disabled.
- **UX:** settings for fractional + location ACL; item tracking mode; lot/serial on movement dialogs; favourites default in movements (B4); per-location low-stock on dashboard (B3).
- **Lifecycle:** `iv_loc_acl` in uninstall/backup; migration `Version1003`.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-26

- **CSV import/export:** `/api/export` streams items, locations, balances, movements, and a DATEV-style movements export as a download; `/api/import/dry-run` and `/api/import/commit` validate and post item rows from pasted text or an uploaded file (office-only, dry-run required before commit).
- **Item photos:** office users can upload, replace, and remove one photo per item (`ItemPhotoController`, stored under app data via `IAppData`); item detail shows the photo with `alt` text set to the item name.
- **Cycle counts (stocktake):** new `/stocktake` area lets office users snapshot system quantities per location, enter counted quantities, and close the count — posting one stock adjustment per counted line. Uncounted items can be left unchanged on close.
- **Location favourites:** any user can star/unstar locations for quick access from the location list.
- **Low-stock notifications:** app admins can configure user/group lists that get a notification (Nextcloud notifications + activity) the first time an item drops below its reorder level, at most once per item per day. Optional per-location reorder hints via `LowStockService::listPerLocation()`.
- **Flange integration groundwork:** `FlangeService`/`FlangeController` expose status and settings so sibling apps (MaintenanceCheck, ProjectCheck) can be allowed to issue stock automatically via `MovementService::issueWithRef()` (server-only path — never reachable through `MovementController`, immutable `ref_type`/`ref_id`, S16).
- **Bulk labels:** items list supports selecting multiple items and printing an A4 label sheet (`/api/items/labels`).
- **Items:** `supplierNote` and `lastPriceMinor` are now editable on create/update and shown on item detail.
- **Mobile gate:** `bootstrap` now advertises `companionApi` and per-feature `capabilities` (`csv`, `photos`, `cycleCount`, `bulkLabels`) for companion clients; mobile app status stays "coming soon".
- **Lifecycle:** uninstall and upgrade-backup now cover the new tables (`iv_notif_log`, `iv_cc_camp`, `iv_cc_line`, `iv_loc_fav`) and the `item_photos` app-data folder.

## 1.0.9 — 2026-07-25

- **Security (access lists):** Config saves validate every user/group id against the Nextcloud directory — unknown uids → 422 `unknown_user`, unknown gids → 422 `unknown_group`, lists unchanged. Stops silent allow-list typos from locking people out when restriction is on (MaintenanceCheck pattern).
- **Atomic writes:** All present list fields are validated before any appconfig key is mutated — a bad group cannot leave a half-applied user list.
- **Bool wire:** `accessRestrictionEnabled` / `allowNegativeStock` accept JSON booleans and `'0'`/`'1'` correctly (`(bool)'0'` is never used — that PHP footgun would force-enable).
- **UX:** Settings maps those 422 details to inline field errors (`aria-invalid`) plus toast.
- **Tests:** unit + integration + mutation harness for ConfigController directory checks (incl. partial-write and `'0'` bool); E2E asserts unknown allow-list user → 422.

## 1.0.8 — 2026-07-25

- **Settings (IMPLEMENTATION §2.1):** Delegated app-administrator list is visible and editable by Nextcloud system admins (L0); L1 sees it read-only. Config API exposes `isSystemAdmin`.
- **E2E (SPEC §14.3):** UJ-1…UJ-7 journeys cover receive/transfer/same-location, insufficient stock, adjust no-op, low-stock boundary, reverse, and settings/app-admins — with axe on key surfaces.
- **Design system:** Section chrome and skip-link spacing use `--iv-space-*` / `--iv-fs-*` tokens (65 ch reading measure on section hints).

## 1.0.7 — 2026-07-25

- **AC-20:** live uninstall drop integration — all 7 `iv_*` tables + appconfig cleared, schema ensurer restores, appconfig snapshot restored for gauntlet continuity
- **N5:** `hashSecret` fails closed when instance `secret` is empty (no static APP_ID pepper); HMAC pepper unit + mutation coverage
- **AC-18:** pairing failure accounting re-checks rate limit under the same exclusive lock (TOCTOU cannot overshoot RATE_MAX)
- **Mobile:** `pairDevice` is `#[NoAdminRequired]` like every other mobile route
- **UX:** movement dialogs disable Confirm/Cancel while pending (no double-submit)
- **Contracts:** mutating API methods must not be `NoCSRFRequired`; N6 provider portability source contracts; N1/N2 latency smoke on warm Docker

## 1.0.6 — 2026-07-24

- **Critical (pages):** `#[NoCSRFRequired]` on all browser page GETs and label print/SVG routes — Nextcloud 34 CSRF middleware was returning 412 on every shell navigation (sibling family apps already had this)
- **Critical (API):** `requestToken()` now reads `OC.requestToken` / `<head data-requesttoken>` — NC34 dropped `<meta name="requesttoken">`, so every SPA fetch was 412 and pages showed “Could not load …”
- **Races:** ConcurrentIssueLock pins `allow_negative_stock=false` in parent + workers (sibling tests flipping the flag no longer let both issues “win”)
- **A11y:** toast region uses `role="region"` with `aria-label` (WCAG 4.1.2)
- **E2E:** Playwright API login + shared storageState; live axe + UJ + UAT screenshots; MSI gate green
- **Security:** pair/device secrets remain HMAC-SHA256 with instance pepper

## 1.0.5 — 2026-07-24

- **AC-21:** axe WCAG 2.1 AA on dashboard, item detail, movements (filters + receive dialog), settings/license fixtures — zero serious/critical
- **AC-22:** screenshot archive under `docs/uat/screenshots/` (7 PNGs incl. 320px + label A12 + family parity); checklist signed; contract requires PNGs + checked criteria
- **API tests:** miss item/location → `unknown_item`/`unknown_location`; `balances?negative=1`; movement kind/item filters
- **JS:** pure helpers exported + unit-tested (`canReverseMovement`, `movementListQuery`, `dateInputToUnix`)
- **Mutation:** BalanceMapper negative filter (3), expanded Iv2Codec (7), Seat/DeviceRank (7); survivors none — MSI-equivalent custom harness (Infection not used; same kill proof)

## 1.0.4 — 2026-07-24

- **UX (UJ-3):** insufficient-stock toasts now name available qty and location (`Only %s left in %s.`) — fixed broken `%n` misuse of `IL10N::t()`
- **API contract:** missing masters return 404 `unknown_item` / `unknown_location` (§4.1)
- **Mobile gate (AC-17/18):** garbage `X-IV-Device-Token` → 401 `auth_required`; deactivated slot keeps token hash → 402 `device_required` (§9.3.4)
- **UX:** movements page filters (kind, item, location, from/to) + pagination; dashboard lists negative balances when negatives are off (S4); transfer Reverse only on the out leg
- **Balances API:** `?negative=1` lists qty &lt; 0
- Tests: envelope message assertions, device gate ladder cases, JS filter/pagination contracts

## 1.0.3 — 2026-07-24

- **Security (AC-2/P1):** `isAccessRestrictionEnabled()` compared with `=== '1'` again — a `!==` flip made default-open behave as default-locked (and the reverse when admins enabled restriction). Regression unit test pins the raw `'0'`/`'1'` byte semantics; mutation harness now refuses to run if the ACL baseline is already red.
- **API:** scan `transfer` without `toLocationId` returns 422 `validation_failed` on that field instead of a opaque 404 on location `0`.
- **Ops (S13):** `occ inventorycheck:rebuild-balances` opens one transaction per item (not one global TX) so repair stays bounded under live traffic.

## 1.0.2 — 2026-07-24

- **PostgreSQL (N6):** `ensureZeroRow` now uses `insertIgnoreConflict` — a raced duplicate insert no longer aborts the movement transaction on PostgreSQL
- **Races (S5/S6):** movements take shared row locks on item/location inside the transaction; deactivate/delete take exclusive locks before the zero-balance / movement-reference checks — stock can no longer be stranded on an entity deactivated mid-movement
- **Races (S7/S8):** item code changes serialise under an app lock; DB unique-violation races surface as 409 `code_exists` instead of 500
- **UX:** transfer insufficient-stock errors now name the source location like issues do
- **API contract:** `GET /api/items?lowStock=` filter implemented (S10 over the item list); canonical `GET /api/items/{id}/label` route added alongside `label.svg`; error envelope always carries `details` (§7.1)
- Tests: dual-process deactivate-vs-movement races, provider-aware lock-suffix unit tests, 4 new movement-engine mutants (7/7 killed)

- **Security (AC-17):** mobile bootstrap requires auth (rungs 1–2); anonymous callers get **401** `auth_required` (not 402 `seat_required`); licensing envelope no longer public
- **Races (AC-16/18):** exclusive locks around seat assign / device create; atomic `rotatePairCode`; pair claim requires `token_hash IS NULL`
- **Schema:** unique indexes on `iv_scan_devices.token_hash` / `pair_code_hash` (NULLs still allowed)
- **Pairing:** contended rate-limit lock retries instead of immediate false 429
- Tests: mobile gate HTTP ladder, ref_type DB round-trip, unique-index contracts

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-24

First production release of InventoryCheck: stock ledger on Nextcloud with items, locations, balances, and an append-only movement history.

- **Ledger:** receive / issue / transfer / adjust with `FOR UPDATE` lock order; immutable rows; reverse via compensating movements
- **ACL:** L0–L3 (allow groups, office groups, app admin); field vs office movement matrix; mobile API gated separately
- **Track L:** seats, device slots, one-time pair codes, atomic claim, rate-limited pairing under exclusive lock
- **Labels:** SVG download + printable blank view (`/items/{id}/label`) with print CSS (A12)
- **UX:** Check-family `iv-` shell, empty states, inline 422 field errors, balance flash, EN/DE l10n, Support & Us
- **Ops:** schema ensure + one-shot demo seed (`demo_seeded`), uninstall drop, upgrade backups, rebuild-balances
- **Gauntlet:** unit, integration, JS contracts, custom mutation killers
